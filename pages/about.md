## About the Collection

This digital collection features four poems written by Cary Stough at different points of his career and in different draft stages including: 

- pdf photocopies of handwritten drafts as well as their typed transcriptions, and typed drafts 
- a folder of PDF and DOCX documents

## Collection Intention
This collection intends to give representation to the process of poetry composition, which is often hidden from the view of readers of poetry. Readers of Cary Stough will now be able to consider the process behind the finished poem as integral to their reading of the poet's oeuvre, as well as begin to think about editing as a literary art practice in itself. 

## About the Creator
Cary Stough is a poet from the Missouri Ozarks. He began writing poetry at a young age. Throughout this collection, you will see his journey from the University of Missouri-Columbia English program to the Brown University MFA in Literary Arts.
